SHORT DESCRIPTION

The Azure Az PowerShell module is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure
resources directly from the PowerShell command line and in PowerShell
scripts.

LONG DESCRIPTION

Azure PowerShell provides cross-platform cmdlets for managing Azure
services. All Azure PowerShell cmdlets work on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and
supported versions of PowerShell 7.

The Azure PowerShell cmdlets follow the naming convention {verb}-Az{noun}.

-   {verb} is an approved PowerShell verb reflecting the corresponding HTTP
    operation.

-   {noun} matches or has a close equivalent to the name of the resource.

The cmdlets produce .NET objects that can be piped between commands
simplifying the sequencing of commands making Azure PowerShell a powerful
solution for scripting and automation purposes.

A PowerShell module is available for each Azure service. For convenience,
we provide a wrapper module named "Az" that comprises the stable modules.
Modules in preview must be installed independently or via the "AzPreview"
wrapper module.

Azure PowerShell is frequently updated to include bug fixes and service
updates. It is recommended to plan to update to the most recent version
regularly (a minimum of twice a year).

GETTING STARTED

1.  Connect to Azure using Connect-AzAccount

2.  Run your first command. For example, create a resource group in the
    east US region.

        New-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyResoureGroup" -location "eastus"
