# Undo-AzRecoveryServicesVaultDeletion

## SYNOPSIS
Undeletes a soft-deleted Recovery Services vault.

## SYNTAX

```
Undo-AzRecoveryServicesVaultDeletion [-ResourceGroupName] <String> [-Name] <String> [-Location] <String>
 [-Force] [-DefaultProfile <IAzureContextContainer>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Undo-AzRecoveryServicesVaultDeletion cmdlet undeletes a soft-deleted Recovery Services vault back to an active state. When a Recovery Services vault is deleted, it enters a soft-deleted state where it can be recovered within the retention period. This cmdlet reverses the deletion operation and makes the vault active again with all its previous configuration.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Undelete a soft-deleted vault
```powershell
PS C:\> $sdVault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesSoftDeletedVault -Location westus | Where-Object { $_.Properties.VaultId -match "wus-vault" }
PS C:\> Undo-AzRecoveryServicesVaultDeletion -ResourceGroupName $sdVault.ResourceGroupName -Name $sdVault.Name -Location "westus"
```

Undeletes a soft-deleted Recovery Services vault by specifying the resource group name, vault name, and location.
