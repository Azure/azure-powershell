```

## DESCRIPTION
The Get-AzRecoveryServicesSoftDeletedVault cmdlet retrieves Recovery Services vaults that have been soft-deleted in a specified Azure location. Soft-deleted vaults are vaults that have been deleted but are still recoverable for a certain retention period. You can optionally filter by resource group name and vault name.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all soft-deleted vaults in a location
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-AzRecoveryServicesSoftDeletedVault -Location "westus"
```

Gets all soft-deleted Recovery Services vaults in the West US location within the subscription context.

### Example 2: Get a specific soft-deleted vault by name
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-AzRecoveryServicesSoftDeletedVault -Location "westus" -Name "wus-rg_fe7567gh-9d2b-4376-aa4a-de1c7176e40e" -ResourceGroupName "wus-rg"
```

Gets a specific soft-deleted Recovery Services vault named "wus-rg_fe7567gh-9d2b-4376-aa4a-de1c7176e40e" in the "wus-rg" resource group.

### Example 3: Filter soft-deleted vaults by original vault name
```powershell
PS C:\> $sdVault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesSoftDeletedVault -Location westus | Where-Object { $_.Properties.VaultId -match "wus-vault" }
```

Gets soft-deleted vaults in West US and filters them to find vaults with "wus-vault" in ARM ID of the original Recovery Services vault.
