## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate** cmdlet gets an SSL certificate for an application gateway.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get a specific SSL certificate
```
PS C:\>$AppGW = Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway -Name "ApplicationGateway01" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
PS C:\> $Cert = Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate -Name "Cert01" -ApplicationGateway $AppGW
```

The first command gets the Application Gateway named ApplicationGateway01 and stores the result in the variable named $AppGW.
The second command gets the SSL certificate named Cert01 from the application gateway stored in the variable named $AppGW.
The command stores the certificate in the variable named $Cert.

### Example 2: Get a list of SSL certificates
```
PS C:\>$AppGW = Get-AzureRmApplicationGateway -Name "ApplicationGateway01" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
PS C:\> $Certs = Get-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate -ApplicationGateway $AppGW
```

The first command gets the Application Gateway named ApplicationGateway01 and stores the result in the variable named $AppGW.
This second command gets a list of SSL certificates from the application gateway stored in the variable named $AppGW.
