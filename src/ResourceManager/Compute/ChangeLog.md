## Current Release

* Updated Set-AzureRmVMChefExtension cmdlet to add following new options :
    - JsonAttribute : A JSON string to be added to the first run of chef-client. e.g. -JsonAttribute '{"container_service": {"chef-init-test": {"command": "C:\\opscode\\chef\\bin"}}}'

    - ChefServiceInterval : Specifies the frequency (in minutes) at which the chef-service runs. If in case you don't want the chef-service to be installed on the Azure VM then set value as 0 in this field. e.g. -ChefServiceInterval 45

## Version 2.3.0
* Update formats for list of VMs, VMScaleSets and ContainerService
    - The default format of Get-AzureRmVM, Get-AzureRmVmss and Get-AzureRmContainerService is not table format when these cmdlets call List Operation
* Fix overprovision issue for VMScaleSet
    - Because of the bug in Compute client library (and Swagger spec) regarding overprovision property of VMScaleSet, this property did not show up correctly.
* Better piping scenario for VMScaleSets and ContainerService cmdlets
    - VMScaleSet and ContainerService now have "ResourceGroupName" property, so when piping Get command to Delete/Update command, -ResourceGroupName is not required.
* Separate paremater sets for Set-AzureRmVM with Generalized and Redeploy parameter
* Reduce time taken by Get-AzureRmVMDiskEncryptionStatus cmdlet from two minutes to under five seconds
* Allow Set-AzureRmVMDiskEncryptionStatus to be used with VHDs residing in multiple resource groups
