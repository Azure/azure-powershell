This project is divided into Unit Tests and Scenario Tests.  
All the Scenario Tests can be found under the ScenarioTests folder.  All other test classes are Unit Tests.

The Unit Tests run in the xUnit test framework.  
xUnit Documentation: http://xunit.github.io/

The Unit Tests make use of the Moq framework to create mock objects of the PowerShell runtime and the 
Hyak management libraries. 
Moq Documentation: https://github.com/Moq/moq4/blob/master/README.md

Unit Tests for cmdlets that use the Batch OM make use of BatchClientBehaviors.  
Using this feature, we insert custom behaviors into the OM service requests that allow
us to modify the Batch request objects, the actions performed on them, and their responses.
BatchClientBehaviors Documentation: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/microsoft.azure.batch.batchclientbehavior.aspx

The Scenario Tests make use of the HTTP recorder/playback functionality in the Hyak
management libraries.  See the Azure PowerShell Developer Guide for more information:
