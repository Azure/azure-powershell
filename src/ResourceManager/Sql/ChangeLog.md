	- Remove-AzureRmSqlServerKeyVaultKey : This cmdlet removes an Azure Key Vault key from a Sql Server.
	- Get-AzureRmSqlServerTransparentDataEncryptionProtector : This cmdlet returns the current encryption protector for a Sql Server.
	- Set-AzureRmSqlServerTransparentDataEncryptionProtector : This cmdlet sets the encryption protector for a Sql Server. The encryption protector can be set to a key from Azure Key Vault or a key that is managed by Azure Sql.
