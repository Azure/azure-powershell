# Upcoming Breaking Changes

## Release 3.0.0

    The following cmdlets were affected this release:

    **Get-AzureRmLogs**
    **Get-AzureRmAlertHistory**
    **Get-AzureRmAutoscaleHistory**
    - The field EventChannels from the EventData object is being deprecated since it is meaningless now. The value currently returned is constant.
    
    **Get-AzureRmUsage**
    - This cmdlet will be deprecated.

    **Remove-AzureRmAlertRule**
    - The output of these cmdlets will change from list with a single object to a single object, not a list, that includes the requestId, and status code.
    
    ```powershell
    # Old
  
    $s1 = Remove-AzureRmAlertRule -res $resourceGroup -name chiricutin
    if ($s1 -ne $null)
    {
      $r = $s1(0).RequestId
      $s = $s1(0).StatusCode
    }

    # New
    $s1 = Remove-AzureRmAlertRule -res $resourceGroup -name chiricutin
    $r = $s1.RequestId
    $s = $s1.StatusCode
    
    ```
    
    **Add-AzureRmLogAlertRule**
    - This cmdlet will be deprecated.
    
    **Get-AzureRmAlertRule**
    - Each element of the the output (a list of objects) of this cmdlet will be flattened, i.e. instead of returning objects with the following structure { Id, Location, Name, Tags, Properties } it will return objects with the structure { Id, Location, Name, Tags, Type, Description, IsEnabled, Condition, Actions, LastUpdatedTime, ...} so all the attributes of an Azure Resource plus all the attributes of an AlertRuleResource at the top level.
    
    ```powershell
    # Old
  
    $rules = Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Res $resourceGroup
	  if ($rules -and $rules.count -ge 1) {
		  write-host -fore red "Error updating alert rule"
      
      Write-host $rules(0).Id
      Write-host $rules(0).Properties.IsEnabled
      Write-host $rules(0).Properties.Condition
	  }

    # New
    $rules = Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Res $resourceGroup
	  if ($rules -and $rules.count -ge 1) {
		  write-host -fore red "Error updating alert rule"
      
      Write-host $rules(0).Id
      
      # Properties will remain for a while
      Write-host $rules(0).Properties.IsEnabled
      
      # But the properties will be at the top level too. Later Properties will be removed
      Write-host $rules(0).IsEnabled
      Write-host $rules(0).Condition
	  }
    
    ```
    
    **Get-AzureRMAutoscaleSetting**
    - The AutoscaleSettingResourceName field will be deprecated in future versions since it always equals the Name field. In this version is optional.

    ```powershell
    # Old
  
    $s1 = Get-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -Name MySetting
    if ($s1.AutoscaleSettingResourceName -ne $s1.Name)
    {
      write-host "There is something wrong with the name"
    }

    # New
    $s1 = Get-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -Name MySetting
    
    # there won't be a AutoscaleSettingResourceName
    write-host $s1.Name
    
    ```
    
    **Remove-AzureRMLogProfile**
    - The output of this cmdlet will change from Boolean to and object containing RequestId and StatusCode.

    ```powershell
    # Old
  
    $s1 = Remove-AzureRMLogProfile --Name myLogProfile
    if ($s1 eq $true)
    {
      write-host "Removed"
    }
    else
    {
      write-host "Failed"
    }

    # New
    $s1 = Remove-AzureRMLogProfile --Name myLogProfile
    $r = $s1.RequestId
    $s = $s1.StatusCode
    
    ```
    
    **Add-LogProfile**
    - The output of this cmdlet will change from an object that includes the requestId, status code, and the updated or newly created resource.
    
    ```powershell
    # Old
  
    $s1 = Add-AzureRmLogProfile -Name default -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/df602c9c-7aa0-407d-a6fb-eb20c8bd1192/resourceGroups/JohnKemTest/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/johnkemtest8162 -Locations Global -categ Delete, Write, Action -retention 3
    $r = $s1.ServiceBusRuleId

    # New
    $s1 = Add-AzureRmLogProfile -Name default -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/df602c9c-7aa0-407d-a6fb-eb20c8bd1192/resourceGroups/JohnKemTest/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/johnkemtest8162 -Locations Global -categ Delete, Write, Action -retention 3
    $r = $s1.RequestId
    $s = $s1.StatusCode
    $a = $s1.NewResource.ServiceBusRuleId
    
    ```
    
    **Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSettings**
    - The command is going to be renamed to Update-AzureRmDiagnsoticSettings

    ```powershell
    # Old
    # Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSettings

    # New
    # Update-AzureRmDiagnosticSettings
    ```
