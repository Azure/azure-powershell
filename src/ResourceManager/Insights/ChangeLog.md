## Version 3.3.1

## Version 3.3.0

## Version 3.2.1

## Version 3.2.0
* Issue #4215 (change request) remove the 15 days limit in the time window for the Get-AzureRmLog cmdlet. Also minor changes to the unit test names.
* Issue #3957 fixed for Get-AzureRmLog
    - Issue #1: The backend returns the records in pages of 200 records each, linked by the continuation token to the next page. The customers were seeing the cmdlet returning only 200 records when they knew there were more. This was happening regardless of the value they set for MaxEvents, unless that value was less than 200.
    - Issue #2: The documentation contained incorrect data about this cmdlet, e.g.: the default timewindow was 1 hour.
    - Fix #1: The cmdlet now follows the continuation token returned by the backend until it reaches MaxEvents or the end of the set.<br>The default value for MaxEvents is 1000 and its maximum is 100000. Any value for MaxEvents that is less than 1 is ignored and the default is used instead. These values and behavior did not change, now they are correctly documented.<br>An alias for MaxEvents has been added -MaxRecords- since the name of the cmdlet does not speak about events anymore, but only about Logs.
    - Fix #2: The documentation contains correct and more detailed information: new alias, correct time window, correct default, minimum, and maximum values.
