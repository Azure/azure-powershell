## Current Release

## Version 3.5.0
* Support Tag as parameters for Find-AzureRmResource
    - Users can now use Tag parameter with Find-AzureRmResource
    - Fixed the issue where illegal combinations of TagName, TagValue with other search parameters was allowed in Find-AzureRmResource and would result in users getting exception from the service by disallowing such combinations. 

## Version 3.4.0
* Support ResourceNameEquals and ResourceGroupNameEquals as parameters for Find-AzureRmResource
    - Users can now use ResourceNameEquals and ResourceGroupNameEquals with Find-AzureRmResource

## Version 3.3.0
* Lookup of AAD group by Id now uses GetObjectsByObjectId AAD Graph call instead of Groups/<id>
    - This will enable Groups lookup in CSP scenario
* Remove unnecessary AAD graph call in Get role assignments logic
    - Only make call when needed instead of always
* Fixed issue where Remove-AzureRmResource would throw an exception if one of the resources passed through the pipeline failed to be removed
    - If cmdlet fails to remove one of the resources, the result will not have an effect on the removal of other resources
