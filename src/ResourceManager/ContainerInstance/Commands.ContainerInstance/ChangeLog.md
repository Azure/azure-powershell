## Version 0.2.13
Microsoft Azure PowerShell - ContainerInstance service cmdlets.

This module is outdated and will go out of support on 29 February 2024.

The Az.ContainerInstance module has all the capabilities of AzureRM.ContainerInstance and provides the following improvements:
* Az.ContainerInstance takes advantage of greater security with token cache encryption and improved authentication.
* Availability in Azure Cloud Shell and on Linux and macOS.

We encourage you to start using the Az module as soon as possible to take advantage of these improvements.

[Update your scripts](https://aka.ms/azpsmigrate) that use AzureRM PowerShell modules to use Az PowerShell modules by 29 February 2024. To automatically update your scripts, follow the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azpsmigratequick).
