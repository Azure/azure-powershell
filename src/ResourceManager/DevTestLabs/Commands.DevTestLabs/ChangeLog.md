Microsoft Azure PowerShell - DevTestLabs service cmdlets.

This module is outdated and will go out of support on 29 February 2024.

The Az.DevTestLabs module has all the capabilities of AzureRM.DevTestLabs and provides the following improvements:
* Az.DevTestLabs takes advantage of greater security with token cache encryption and improved authentication.
* Availability in Azure Cloud Shell and on Linux and macOS.

We encourage you to start using the Az module as soon as possible to take advantage of these improvements.
