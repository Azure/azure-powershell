## Current Release

## Version 3.3.0
* Updated help for all cmdlets to include output as well as more descriptions of parameters and the inclusion of aliases.
* Update New-AdlStore and Set-AdlStore to support commitment tier options for the service.
* Added OutputType mismatch warnings to all cmdlets with incorrect OutputType attributes. These will be fixed in a future breaking change release.
* Add Diagnostic logging support to Import-AdlStoreItem and Export-AdlStoreItem. This can be enabled through the following parameters:
    * -Debug, enables full diagnostic logging as well as debug logging to the PowerShell console. Most verbose options
    * -DiagnosticLogLevel, allows finer control of the output than debug. If used with debug, this is ignored and debug logging is used.
    * -DiagnosticLogPath, optionally specify the file to write diagnostic logs to. By default it is written to a file under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AdlDataTransfer
* Added support to New-AdlStore to explicitly opt-out of account encryption. To do so, create the account with the -DisableEncryption flag.

## Version 3.2.0
* Introduction of deprecation warning for nested properties for all ARM resources. Nested properties will be removed in a future release and all properties will be moved one level up.
* Removed the ability to set encryption in Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreAccount (never was supported)
* Added ability to enable/disable firewall rules and the trusted id providers during Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreAccount
* Added a new cmdlet: Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreItemExpiry, which allows the user to set or remove the expiration for files (not folders) in their ADLS account.
* Small fix for friendly date properties to pivot off UTC time instead of local time, ensuring standard time reporting.

## Version 3.1.0
* Improvements to import and export data cmdlets
    - Drastically increased performance for distributed download scenarios, where multiple sessions are running across many clients targeting the same ADLS account.
    - Better error handling and messaging for both upload and download scenarios.

    - The below cmdlets can be used to manage firewall rules for an ADLS account:
    - Add-AzureRMDataLakeStoreFirewallRule

    - Get-AzureRMDataLakeStoreFirewallRule
    - Remove-AzureRMDataLakeStoreFirewallRule
* Full Trusted ID provider management CRUD
    - The below cmdlets can be used to manage trusted identity providers for an ADLS account:
    - Add-AzureRMDataLakeStoreTrustedIdProvider
    - Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreTrustedIdProvider
    - Get-AzureRMDataLakeStoreTrustedIdProvider
    - Remove-AzureRMDataLakeStoreTrustedIdProvider
* Account Encryption Support
    - You can now encrypt newly created ADLS accounts as well as enable encryption on existing ADLS accounts using the New-AzureRMDataLakeStoreAccount and Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreAccount cmdlets, respectively.
