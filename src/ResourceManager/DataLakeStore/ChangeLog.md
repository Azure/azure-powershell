* Added ability to enable/disable firewall rules and the trusted id providers during Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreAccount
* Added a new cmdlet: Set-AzureRMDataLakeStoreItemExpiry, which allows the user to set or remove the expiration for files (not folders) in their ADLS account.
* Small fix for friendly date properties to pivot off UTC time instead of local time, ensuring standard time reporting.
