# Az.DeviceRegistry
This directory contains the PowerShell module for the DeviceRegistry service.

---
## Info
- Modifiable: yes
- Generated: all
- Committed: yes

## Detail
This module was primarily generated via [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) using the [PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.powershell) extension.

## Module Requirements
- [Az.Accounts module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Accounts/), version 2.7.5 or greater

## Authentication
AutoRest does not generate authentication code for the module. Authentication is handled via Az.Accounts by altering the HTTP payload before it is sent.

## Development

```yaml
# pin the swagger version by using the commit id instead of branch name
commit: 1e620cfbf7df188acef4d6b4a8752aa3aa82fa02
require:
# readme.azure.noprofile.md is the common configuration file
  - $(this-folder)/../../readme.azure.noprofile.md
  - $(repo)/specification/deviceregistry/resource-manager/readme.md
# If the swagger has not been put in the repo, you may uncomment the following line and refer to it locally
# - (this-folder)/relative-path-to-your-local-readme.md

try-require: 
  - $(repo)/specification/deviceregistry/resource-manager/readme.powershell.md

# For new RP, the version is 0.1.0
module-version: 0.1.0
# Normally, title is the service name
title: DeviceRegistry

directive:
  # Following are common directives which are normally required in all the RPs
  # 1. Remove the unexpanded parameter set
  # 2. For New-* cmdlets, ViaIdentity is not required
  # Following two directives are v4 specific
  - where:
      variant: ^(Create|Update)(?!.*?(Expanded|JsonFilePath|JsonString))
    remove: true
  - where:
      variant: ^CreateViaIdentity.*$
    remove: true
  # Remove OperationStatus from autorest generation.
  # Pwsh polls Async OperationStatuses during Create/Updates automatically
  # and the generated commandlets do not work due to Async-OperationStatus
  # uri signing query params (see here: https://armwiki.azurewebsites.net/api_contracts/AsyncOperationSigningAndValidation.html#async-operation-uri-signing)
  - where:
      subject: OperationStatus
    remove: true
  # Follow directive is v3 specific. If you are using v3, uncomment following directive and comments out two directives above
