# Az.KeyVault Module
## Description
Microsoft Azure PowerShell: KeyVault cmdlets

## Az.KeyVault Cmdlets
### [Add-AzKeyVaultCertificateContact](Add-AzKeyVaultCertificateContact.md)
Sets the certificate contacts for the specified key vault.
This operation requires the certificates/managecontacts permission.

### [Backup-AzKeyVaultCertificate](Backup-AzKeyVaultCertificate.md)
Requests that a backup of the specified certificate be downloaded to the client.
All versions of the certificate will be downloaded.
This operation requires the certificates/backup permission.

### [Backup-AzKeyVaultKey](Backup-AzKeyVaultKey.md)
The Key Backup operation exports a key from Azure Key Vault in a protected form.
Note that this operation does NOT return key material in a form that can be used outside the Azure Key Vault system, the returned key material is either protected to a Azure Key Vault HSM or to Azure Key Vault itself.
The intent of this operation is to allow a client to GENERATE a key in one Azure Key Vault instance, BACKUP the key, and then RESTORE it into another Azure Key Vault instance.
The BACKUP operation may be used to export, in protected form, any key type from Azure Key Vault.
Individual versions of a key cannot be backed up.
BACKUP / RESTORE can be performed within geographical boundaries only; meaning that a BACKUP from one geographical area cannot be restored to another geographical area.
For example, a backup from the US geographical area cannot be restored in an EU geographical area.
This operation requires the key/backup permission.

Note that the ENCRYPT operation only supports a single block of data, the size of which is dependent on the target key and the encryption algorithm to be used.
The ENCRYPT operation is only strictly necessary for symmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault since protection with an asymmetric key can be performed using public portion of the key.
This operation is supported for asymmetric keys as a convenience for callers that have a key-reference but do not have access to the public key material.
This operation requires the keys/encrypt permission.

The RESTORE operation may be used to import a previously backed up key.
Individual versions of a key cannot be restored.
The key is restored in its entirety with the same key name as it had when it was backed up.
If the key name is not available in the target Key Vault, the RESTORE operation will be rejected.
While the key name is retained during restore, the final key identifier will change if the key is restored to a different vault.
Restore will restore all versions and preserve version identifiers.
The RESTORE operation is subject to security constraints: The target Key Vault must be owned by the same Microsoft Azure Subscription as the source Key Vault The user must have RESTORE permission in the target Key Vault.

### [Test-AzKeyVaultKey](Test-AzKeyVaultKey.md)
The VERIFY operation is applicable to symmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault.
VERIFY is not strictly necessary for asymmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault since signature verification can be performed using the public portion of the key but this operation is supported as a convenience for callers that only have a key-reference and not the public portion of the key.
This operation requires the keys/verify permission.

### [Undo-AzKeyVaultCertificateRemoval](Undo-AzKeyVaultCertificateRemoval.md)
The RecoverDeletedCertificate operation performs the reversal of the Delete operation.
The operation is applicable in vaults enabled for soft-delete, and must be issued during the retention interval (available in the deleted certificate's attributes).
