.SYNOPSIS
    Run AzureStack fabric admin logical subnet tests.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run AzureStack fabric admin logical subnet tests using either mock client or our client.
	The mock client allows for recording and playback.  This allows for offline tests.

.PARAMETER RunRaw
    Run using our client creation path.

.EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> .\src\LogicalSubnet.Tests.ps1
	Describing LogicalSubnets
	  [+] TestListLogicalSubnets 1.55s
	  [+] TestGetLogicalSubnet 286ms
	  [+] TestGetAllLogicalSubnets 429ms
