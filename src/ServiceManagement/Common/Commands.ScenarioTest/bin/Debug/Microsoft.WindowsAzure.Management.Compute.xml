            The Begin Upgrading Deployment By Name operation initiates an

            This operation is an asynchronous operation. To determine whether
            the request has been processed, call Get Operation Status. For

            To perform an automatic update of a deployment, call Upgrade
            Deployment or Change Deployment Configuration with the Mode
            element set to automatic. The update proceeds from that point
            without a need for further input. You can call Get Operation

            manual update, first call Upgrade Deployment with the Mode element

            domain within the deployment. You should make sure that the
            operation is complete by calling Get Operation Status before
            updating the next domain. Important: An update that adds or
            removes role instances will result in a configuration update to
            all roles that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role
            instances need to be notified of new role instances so that all
            role instances can communicate together in the cloud service. By

            information on modifying the number of update domains in the
            service definition file, see the Azure Service Definition Schema

            To perform an automatic update of a deployment, call Upgrade
            Deployment or Change Deployment Configuration with the Mode
            element set to automatic. The update proceeds from that point
            without a need for further input. You can call Get Operation
            Status to determine when the update is complete. To perform a
            manual update, first call Upgrade Deployment with the Mode element
            set to manual. Next, call Walk Upgrade Domain to update each
            domain within the deployment. You should make sure that the
            operation is complete by calling Get Operation Status before
            updating the next domain. Important: An update that adds or
            removes role instances will result in a configuration update to
            all roles that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role
            instances need to be notified of new role instances so that all
            role instances can communicate together in the cloud service. By
            default, a cloud service is deployed with five update domains,
            which are updated one at a time during an in-place update. For
            information on modifying the number of update domains in the
            service definition file, see the Azure Service Definition Schema
            (.csdef File). To determine the update domain in which a

            The Rollback Update Or Upgrade By Deployment Slot operation cancels
            an in-progress configuration update and returns the deployment to
            its state before the update was started. This operation can only
            be called when an update is in progress on the deployment. The
            deployment status can be detected by calling the Get Deployment
            operation or Get Hosted Service Properties operation and
            inspecting the RollbackAllowed element. If the value returned is
            true a rollback can be performed.  (see

            your deployment, proceed in this order: Call Upgrade Deployment
            with the Mode element set to manual. Call Walk Upgrade Domain to
            update each domain within the deployment. Update domains must be
            updated in order. For example, begin with domain 0, proceed to
            domain 1, and so on. Important: An update that adds or removes
            role instances will result in a configuration update to all roles
            that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role instances
            need to be notified of new role instances so that all role
            instances can communicate together in the cloud service. While an
            update is in progress, call Get Deployment to determine its
            status. If the update is in progress, Get Deployment returns an
            UpgradeStatus element that contains information about the update.
            If the update is complete, or if no update is in progress, then
            the UpgradeStatus element is null.  (see
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460800.aspx

            To perform an automatic update of a deployment, call Upgrade

            The Begin Upgrading Deployment By Slot operation initiates an

            To perform an automatic update of a deployment, call Upgrade
            Deployment or Change Deployment Configuration with the Mode
            element set to automatic. The update proceeds from that point
            without a need for further input. You can call Get Operation
            Status to determine when the update is complete. To perform a
            manual update, first call Upgrade Deployment with the Mode element
            set to manual. Next, call Walk Upgrade Domain to update each
            domain within the deployment. You should make sure that the
            operation is complete by calling Get Operation Status before
            updating the next domain. Important: An update that adds or
            removes role instances will result in a configuration update to
            all roles that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role
            instances need to be notified of new role instances so that all
            role instances can communicate together in the cloud service. By
            default, a cloud service is deployed with five update domains,
            which are updated one at a time during an in-place update. For
            information on modifying the number of update domains in the
            service definition file, see the Azure Service Definition Schema
            (.csdef File). To determine the update domain in which a

            The Upgrade Deployment By Name operation initiates an update of
            role instances in a deployment using the package and configuration
            that you specify. For more information about updating role
            instances, see Update an Azure Service at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh472157.aspx.
            This operation is an asynchronous operation. To determine whether
            the request has been processed, call Get Operation Status. For
            more information on asynchronous operations, see Tracking
            Asynchronous Service Management Requests at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460791.aspx.
            To perform an automatic update of a deployment, call Upgrade
            Deployment or Change Deployment Configuration with the Mode
            element set to automatic. The update proceeds from that point
            without a need for further input. You can call Get Operation
            Status to determine when the update is complete. To perform a
            manual update, first call Upgrade Deployment with the Mode element
            set to manual. Next, call Walk Upgrade Domain to update each
            domain within the deployment. You should make sure that the
            operation is complete by calling Get Operation Status before
            updating the next domain. Important: An update that adds or
            removes role instances will result in a configuration update to
            all roles that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role
            instances need to be notified of new role instances so that all
            role instances can communicate together in the cloud service. By
            default, a cloud service is deployed with five update domains,
            which are updated one at a time during an in-place update. For

            The Walk Upgrade Domain By Deployment Slot operation specifies an
            update domain in which a role instance must be updated. For more
            information about updating role instances, see Update an Azure
            Service at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh472157.aspx.
            This operation is an asynchronous operation. To determine whether
            the Management service has finished processing the request, call
            Get Operation Status. For more information on asynchronous
            operations, see Tracking Asynchronous Service Management Requests
            at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460791.aspx.
            Prior to calling the Walk Upgrade Domain operation you must have
            called Upgrade Deployment, Change Deployment Configuration, or
            Rollback Update Or Upgrade. By default, a service is deployed with
            five update domains, which are updated one at a time during an
            in-place update. For information on modifying the number of update
            domains in the service definition file, see the Azure Service
            Definition Schema (.csdef File). To perform a manual update of
            your deployment, proceed in this order: Call Upgrade Deployment
            with the Mode element set to manual. Call Walk Upgrade Domain to
            update each domain within the deployment. Update domains must be
            updated in order. For example, begin with domain 0, proceed to
            domain 1, and so on. Important: An update that adds or removes
            role instances will result in a configuration update to all roles
            that are deployed in the cloud service. Existing role instances
            need to be notified of new role instances so that all role
            instances can communicate together in the cloud service. While an
            update is in progress, call Get Deployment to determine its
            status. If the update is in progress, Get Deployment returns an
            UpgradeStatus element that contains information about the update.
            If the update is complete, or if no update is in progress, then
            the UpgradeStatus element is null.  (see

            The Create Data Disk operation adds a data disk to a virtual
            machine. There are three ways to create the data disk using the
            Add Data Disk operation. Option 1 - Attach an empty data disk to
            the role by specifying the disk label and location of the disk
            image. Do not include the DiskName and SourceMediaLink elements in
            the request body. Include the MediaLink element and reference a
            blob that is in the same geographical region as the role. You can
            also omit the MediaLink element. In this usage, Azure will create
            the data disk in the storage account configured as default for the
            role. Option 2 - Attach an existing data disk that is in the image
            repository. Do not include the DiskName and SourceMediaLink
            elements in the request body. Specify the data disk to use by
            including the DiskName element. Note: If included the in the

            create a deployment of a virtual machine, you should make sure
            that the cloud service and the disk or image that you use are
            located in the same region. For example, if the cloud service was
            created in the West US region, the disk or image that you use
            should also be located in a storage account in the West US region.
