### Release 4.0.0 - November 2017

The following cmdlets were affected this release:

**Add-AzureRMLogAlertRule**
- The **Add-AzureRMLogAlertRule** cmdlet has been deprecated
- After October 1st using this cmdlet will no longer have any effect as this functionality is being transitioned to Activity Log Alerts. Please see https://aka.ms/migratemealerts for more information.

**Get-AzureRMUsage**
- The **Get-AzureRMUsage** cmdlet has been deprecated

**Get-AzureRmAlertHistory** / **Get-AzureRmAutoscaleHistory** / **Get-AzureRmLogs**
- Output change: The field EventChannels from the EventData object (returned by these cmdlets) is being deprecated since it now returns a constant value (Admin,Operation.)

**Get-AzureRmAlertRule**
- Output change: The output of this cmdlet will be flattened, i.e. elimination of the properties field, to improve the user experience.

```powershell
# Old
$rules = Get-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup
if ($rules -and $rules.count -ge 1)
{
	Write-Host -Foreground Red "Error updating alert rule"
	Write-Host $rules[0].Id
	Write-Host $rules[0].Properties.IsEnabled
	Write-Host $rules[0].Properties.Condition
}

# New
$rules = Get-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup
if ($rules -and $rules.count -ge 1)
{
	Write-Host -Foreground red "Error updating alert rule"
	Write-Host $rules[0].Id

	# Properties will remain for a while
	Write-Host $rules[0].Properties.IsEnabled
      
	# But the properties will be at the top level too. Later Properties will be removed
	Write-Host $rules[0].IsEnabled
	Write-Host $rules[0].Condition
}
```

**Get-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting**
- Output change: The AutoscaleSettingResourceName field will be deprecated since it always equals the Name field.

```powershell
# Old
$s1 = Get-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -Name MySetting
if ($s1.AutoscaleSettingResourceName -ne $s1.Name)
{
	Write-Host "There is something wrong with the name"
}

# New
$s1 = Get-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -Name MySetting
    
# there won't be a AutoscaleSettingResourceName
Write-Host $s1.Name    
```

**Remove-AzureRmAlertRule** / **Remove-AzureRmLogProfile**
- Output change: The type of the output will change to return a single object containing the request Id and the status code.

```powershell
# Old
$s1 = Remove-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -name $ruleName
if ($s1 -ne $null)
{
	$r = $s1[0].RequestId
	$s = $s1[0].StatusCode
}

# New
$s1 = Remove-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -name $ruleName
$r = $s1.RequestId
$s = $s1.StatusCode
```
