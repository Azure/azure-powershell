# Az.Ssh Module

This module allows you to create an interactive shell connection to Azure Resources, such as Azure VMs or Arc Servers, using SSH (Secure Shell). The connection can be established using AAD (Azure Active Directory) accounts, or local machine accounts. Note that this module requires that an SSH client application (such as OpenSSH) be installed and discoverable on the client machine.

## Az.Ssh Cmdlets

Start interactive SSH session to an Azure Resource.

### [Export-AzSshConfig](Export-AzSshConfig.md)
Export SSH configuration file which can then be used by clients that support OpenSSH config and certificates to connect to Azure Resources.
