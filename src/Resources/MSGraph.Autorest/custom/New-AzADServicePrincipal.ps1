COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

ADDIN <IMicrosoftGraphAddIn[]>: Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts. For example, applications that can render file streams may set the addIns property for its 'FileHandler' functionality. This will let services like Microsoft 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on.
  [Id <String>]: 
  [Property <IMicrosoftGraphKeyValue[]>]: 
    [Key <String>]: Key.
    [Value <String>]: Value.

  [AllowedMemberType <String[]>]: Specifies whether this app role can be assigned to users and groups (by setting to ['User']), to other application's (by setting to ['Application'], or both (by setting to ['User', 'Application']). App roles supporting assignment to other applications' service principals are also known as application permissions. The 'Application' value is only supported for app roles defined on application entities.
  [Description <String>]: The description for the app role. This is displayed when the app role is being assigned and, if the app role functions as an application permission, during  consent experiences.
  [DisplayName <String>]: Display name for the permission that appears in the app role assignment and consent experiences.
  [Id <String>]: Unique role identifier inside the appRoles collection. When creating a new app role, a new Guid identifier must be provided.
  [IsEnabled <Boolean?>]: When creating or updating an app role, this must be set to true (which is the default). To delete a role, this must first be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, this role may be removed.
