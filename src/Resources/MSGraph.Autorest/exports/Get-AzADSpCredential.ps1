COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

SERVICEPRINCIPALOBJECT <IMicrosoftGraphServicePrincipal>: The service principal object, could be used as pipeline input.
  [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

This will let services like Microsoft 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on.
    [Id <String>]: 
    [Property <IMicrosoftGraphKeyValue[]>]: 
      [Key <String>]: Key.
      [Value <String>]: Value.

  [AlternativeName <String[]>]: Used to retrieve service principals by subscription, identify resource group and full resource ids for managed identities. Supports $filter (eq, NOT, ge, le, startsWith).
  [AppDescription <String>]: The description exposed by the associated application.
  [AppDisplayName <String>]: The display name exposed by the associated application.
  [AppId <String>]: The unique identifier for the associated application (its appId property).

    [AllowedMemberType <String[]>]: Specifies whether this app role can be assigned to users and groups (by setting to ['User']), to other application's (by setting to ['Application'], or both (by setting to ['User', 'Application']). App roles supporting assignment to other applications' service principals are also known as application permissions. The 'Application' value is only supported for app roles defined on application entities.
    [Description <String>]: The description for the app role. This is displayed when the app role is being assigned and, if the app role functions as an application permission, during  consent experiences.
    [DisplayName <String>]: Display name for the permission that appears in the app role assignment and consent experiences.
    [Id <String>]: Unique role identifier inside the appRoles collection. When creating a new app role, a new Guid identifier must be provided.
