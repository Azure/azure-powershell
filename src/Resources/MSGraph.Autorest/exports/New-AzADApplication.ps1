COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

ADDIN <IMicrosoftGraphAddIn[]>: Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts. For example, applications that can render file streams may set the addIns property for its 'FileHandler' functionality. This will let services like Office 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on. To construct, see NOTES section for ADDIN properties and create a hash table.
  [Id <String>]: 
  [Property <IMicrosoftGraphKeyValue[]>]: 
    [Key <String>]: Key.
    [Value <String>]: Value.
  [Type <String>]: 

API <IMicrosoftGraphApiApplication>: apiApplication To construct, see NOTES section for API properties and create a hash table.
  [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  [AcceptMappedClaim <Boolean?>]: When true, allows an application to use claims mapping without specifying a custom signing key.
  [KnownClientApplication <String[]>]: Used for bundling consent if you have a solution that contains two parts: a client app and a custom web API app. If you set the appID of the client app to this value, the user only consents once to the client app. Azure AD knows that consenting to the client means implicitly consenting to the web API and automatically provisions service principals for both APIs at the same time. Both the client and the web API app must be registered in the same tenant.
  [Oauth2PermissionScope <IMicrosoftGraphPermissionScope[]>]: The definition of the delegated permissions exposed by the web API represented by this application registration. These delegated permissions may be requested by a client application, and may be granted by users or administrators during consent. Delegated permissions are sometimes referred to as OAuth 2.0 scopes.
    [AdminConsentDescription <String>]: A description of the delegated permissions, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users. This text appears in tenant-wide admin consent experiences.
    [AdminConsentDisplayName <String>]: The permission's title, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users.
    [Id <String>]: Unique delegated permission identifier inside the collection of delegated permissions defined for a resource application.
    [IsEnabled <Boolean?>]: When creating or updating a permission, this property must be set to true (which is the default). To delete a permission, this property must first be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, the permission may be removed.
    [Origin <String>]: 
    [Type <String>]: Specifies whether this delegated permission should be considered safe for non-admin users to consent to on behalf of themselves, or whether an administrator should be required for consent to the permissions. This will be the default behavior, but each customer can choose to customize the behavior in their organization (by allowing, restricting or limiting user consent to this delegated permission.)
    [UserConsentDescription <String>]: A description of the delegated permissions, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.
    [UserConsentDisplayName <String>]: A title for the permission, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.
    [Value <String>]: Specifies the value to include in the scp (scope) claim in access tokens. Must not exceed 120 characters in length. Allowed characters are : ! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  =  ? @ [ ] ^ + _  {  } ~, as well as characters in the ranges 0-9, A-Z and a-z. Any other character, including the space character, are not allowed. May not begin with ..
  [PreAuthorizedApplication <IMicrosoftGraphPreAuthorizedApplication[]>]: Lists the client applications that are pre-authorized with the specified delegated permissions to access this application's APIs. Users are not required to consent to any pre-authorized application (for the permissions specified). However, any additional permissions not listed in preAuthorizedApplications (requested through incremental consent for example) will require user consent.
    [AppId <String>]: The unique identifier for the application.
    [DelegatedPermissionId <String[]>]: The unique identifier for the oauth2PermissionScopes the application requires.
  [RequestedAccessTokenVersion <Int32?>]: Specifies the access token version expected by this resource. This changes the version and format of the JWT produced independent of the endpoint or client used to request the access token.  The endpoint used, v1.0 or v2.0, is chosen by the client and only impacts the version of id_tokens. Resources need to explicitly configure requestedAccessTokenVersion to indicate the supported access token format.  Possible values for requestedAccessTokenVersion are 1, 2, or null. If the value is null, this defaults to 1, which corresponds to the v1.0 endpoint.  If signInAudience on the application is configured as AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount, the value for this property must be 2

APPROLE <IMicrosoftGraphAppRole[]>: The collection of roles assigned to the application. With app role assignments, these roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals associated with other applications. Not nullable. To construct, see NOTES section for APPROLE properties and create a hash table.
  [AllowedMemberType <String[]>]: Specifies whether this app role can be assigned to users and groups (by setting to ['User']), to other application's (by setting to ['Application'], or both (by setting to ['User', 'Application']). App roles supporting assignment to other applications' service principals are also known as application permissions. The 'Application' value is only supported for app roles defined on application entities.
  [Description <String>]: The description for the app role. This is displayed when the app role is being assigned and, if the app role functions as an application permission, during  consent experiences.
  [DisplayName <String>]: Display name for the permission that appears in the app role assignment and consent experiences.
  [Id <String>]: Unique role identifier inside the appRoles collection. When creating a new app role, a new Guid identifier must be provided.
  [IsEnabled <Boolean?>]: When creating or updating an app role, this must be set to true (which is the default). To delete a role, this must first be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, this role may be removed.
  [Value <String>]: Specifies the value to include in the roles claim in ID tokens and access tokens authenticating an assigned user or service principal. Must not exceed 120 characters in length. Allowed characters are : ! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  =  ? @ [ ] ^ + _  {  } ~, as well as characters in the ranges 0-9, A-Z and a-z. Any other character, including the space character, are not allowed. May not begin with ..

        [AdminConsentDisplayName <String>]: The permission's title, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users.
        [Id <String>]: Unique delegated permission identifier inside the collection of delegated permissions defined for a resource application.
        [IsEnabled <Boolean?>]: When creating or updating a permission, this property must be set to true (which is the default). To delete a permission, this property must first be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, the permission may be removed.
        [Origin <String>]: 
        [Type <String>]: Specifies whether this delegated permission should be considered safe for non-admin users to consent to on behalf of themselves, or whether an administrator should be required for consent to the permissions.

        [UserConsentDescription <String>]: A description of the delegated permissions, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.
        [UserConsentDisplayName <String>]: A title for the permission, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.
        [Value <String>]: Specifies the value to include in the scp (scope) claim in access tokens. Must not exceed 120 characters in length. Allowed characters are : ! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  =  ? @ [ ] ^ + _  {  } ~, as well as characters in the ranges 0-9, A-Z and a-z. Any other character, including the space character, are not allowed. May not begin with ..
      [PreAuthorizedApplication <IMicrosoftGraphPreAuthorizedApplication[]>]: Lists the client applications that are pre-authorized with the specified delegated permissions to access this application's APIs.

        [DelegatedPermissionId <String[]>]: The unique identifier for the oauth2PermissionScopes the application requires.
      [RequestedAccessTokenVersion <Int32?>]: Specifies the access token version expected by this resource. This changes the version and format of the JWT produced independent of the endpoint or client used to request the access token.  The endpoint used, v1.0 or v2.0, is chosen by the client and only impacts the version of id_tokens. Resources need to explicitly configure requestedAccessTokenVersion to indicate the supported access token format.  Possible values for requestedAccessTokenVersion are 1, 2, or null. If the value is null, this defaults to 1, which corresponds to the v1.0 endpoint.  If signInAudience on the application is configured as AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount, the value for this property must be 2

      [Id <String>]: Unique role identifier inside the appRoles collection. When creating a new app role, a new Guid identifier must be provided.
      [IsEnabled <Boolean?>]: When creating or updating an app role, this must be set to true (which is the default). To delete a role, this must first be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, this role may be removed.
      [Value <String>]: Specifies the value to include in the roles claim in ID tokens and access tokens authenticating an assigned user or service principal. Must not exceed 120 characters in length. Allowed characters are : ! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  =  ? @ [ ] ^ + _  {  } ~, as well as characters in the ranges 0-9, A-Z and a-z. Any other character, including the space character, are not allowed. May not begin with ..
