Supports $filter (eq, ne, not, ge, le, in).
  [OnPremisesSyncEnabled <Boolean?>]: true if this object is synced from an on-premises directory; false if this object was originally synced from an on-premises directory but is no longer synced; null if this object has never been synced from an on-premises directory (default).

  [PasswordProfile <IMicrosoftGraphPasswordProfile>]: passwordProfile
    [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    [ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn <Boolean?>]: true if the user must change her password on the next login; otherwise false. If not set, default is false. NOTE:  For Azure B2C tenants, set to false and instead use custom policies and user flows to force password reset at first sign in. See Force password reset at first logon.
    [ForceChangePasswordNextSignInWithMfa <Boolean?>]: If true, at next sign-in, the user must perform a multi-factor authentication (MFA) before being forced to change their password. The behavior is identical to forceChangePasswordNextSignIn except that the user is required to first perform a multi-factor authentication before password change. After a password change, this property will be automatically reset to false. If not set, default is false.
    [Password <String>]: The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next login.
