## Upcoming Release

## Version 3.1.0
* Updated Az.Batch to use `Microsoft.Azure.Management.Batch` SDK version to 11.0.0
* Added the ability to set the BatchAccount Identity in the `New-AzBatchAccount` cmdlet

## Version 3.0.0
* Updated Az.Batch to use `Microsoft.Azure.Batch` SDK version 13.0.0 and `Microsoft.Azure.Management.Batch` SDK version 9.0.0.
* Added the ability to select the kind of certificate being added using the new `-CertificateKind` parameter to `New-AzBatchCertificate`.
* Removed `ApplicationPackages` property from `PSApplication` which was previously always `$null`.
  - The specific packages inside of an application now can be retrieved using `Get-AzBatchApplicationPackage`. For example: `Get-AzBatchApplication -AccountName myaccount -ResourceGroupName myresourcegroup -ApplicationId myapplication`.
* When creating a pool using `New-AzBatchPool`, the `VirtualMachineImageId` property of `PSImageReference` can now only refer to a Shared Image Gallery image.
* When creating a pool using `New-AzBatchPool`, the pool can be provisioned without a public IP using the new `PublicIPAddressConfiguration` property of `PSNetworkConfiguration`.
  - The `PublicIPs` property of `PSNetworkConfiguration` has moved in to `PSPublicIPAddressConfiguration` as well. This property can only be specified if `IPAddressProvisioningType` is `UserManaged`.

## Version 2.0.2
* Update references in .psd1 to use relative path
* Fix issue #10602, where **New-AzBatchPool** did not properly send `VirtualMachineConfiguration.ContainerConfiguration` or `VirtualMachineConfiguration.DataDisks` to the server.

## Version 2.0.1
* Renamed `CoreQuota` on `BatchAccountContext` to `DedicatedCoreQuota`. There is also a new `LowPriorityCoreQuota`.
  - This impacts **Get-AzBatchAccount**.
* **New-AzBatchTask** `-ResourceFile` parameter now takes a collection of `PSResourceFile` objects, which can be constructed using the new **New-AzBatchResourceFile** cmdlet.
* New **New-AzBatchResourceFile** cmdlet to help create `PSResourceFile` objects. These can be supplied to **New-AzBatchTask** on the `-ResourceFile` parameter.
  - This supports two new kinds of resource file in addition to the existing `HttpUrl` way:
    - `AutoStorageContainerName` based resource files download an entire auto-storage container to the Batch node.
    - `StorageContainerUrl` based resource files download the container specified in the URL to the Batch node.
* Removed `ApplicationPackages` property of `PSApplication` returned by **Get-AzBatchApplication**.
  - The specific packages inside of an application now can be retrieved using **Get-AzBatchApplicationPackage**. For example: `Get-AzBatchApplication -AccountName myaccount -ResourceGroupName myresourcegroup -ApplicationId myapplication`.
* Renamed `ApplicationId` to `ApplicationName` on **Get-AzBatchApplicationPackage**, **New-AzBatchApplicationPackage**, **Remove-AzBatchApplicationPackage**, **Get-AzBatchApplication**, **New-AzBatchApplication**, **Remove-AzBatchApplication**, and **Set-AzBatchApplication**.
  - `ApplicationId` now is an alias of `ApplicationName`.
* Added new `PSWindowsUserConfiguration` property to `PSUserAccount`.
* Renamed `Version` to `Name` on `PSApplicationPackage`.
* Renamed `BlobSource` to `HttpUrl` on `PSResourceFile`.
* Removed `OSDisk` property from `PSVirtualMachineConfiguration`.
* Removed **Set-AzBatchPoolOSVersion**. This operation is no longer supported.
* Removed `TargetOSVersion` from `PSCloudServiceConfiguration`.
* Renamed `CurrentOSVersion` to `OSVersion` on `PSCloudServiceConfiguration`.
* Removed `DataEgressGiB` and `DataIngressGiB` from `PSPoolUsageMetrics`.
* Removed **Get-AzBatchNodeAgentSku** and replaced it with  **Get-AzBatchSupportedImage**. 
  - **Get-AzBatchSupportedImage** returns the same data as **Get-AzBatchNodeAgentSku** but in a more friendly format.
  - New non-verified images are also now returned. Additional information about `Capabilities` and `BatchSupportEndOfLife` for each image is also included.
* Added ability to mount remote file-systems on each node of a pool via the new `MountConfiguration` parameter of **New-AzBatchPool**.
* Now support network security rules blocking network access to a pool based on the source port of the traffic. This is done via the `SourcePortRanges` property on `PSNetworkSecurityGroupRule`.
* When running a container, Batch now supports executing the task in the container working directory or in the Batch task working directory. This is controlled by the `WorkingDirectory` property on `PSTaskContainerSettings`.
* Added ability to specify a collection of public IPs on `PSNetworkConfiguration` via the new `PublicIPs` property. This guarantees nodes in the Pool will have an IP from the list user provided IPs.
* When not specified, the default value of `WaitForSuccess` on `PSSTartTask` is now `$True` (was `$False`).
* When not specified, the default value of `Scope` on `PSAutoUserSpecification` is now `Pool` (was `Task` on Windows and `Pool` on Linux).

## Version 1.1.2
* **Get-AzBatchNodeAgentSku** is deprecated and will be replaced by **Get-AzBatchSupportImage** in version 2.0.0.

## Version 1.1.1
* Fixed typo in help message and documentation to capitalize Windows
* Fixed miscellaneous typos across module

## Version 1.1.0
* Updated cmdlets with plural nouns to singular, and deprecated plural names.

## Version 1.0.0
* General availability of `Az.Batch` module
* Added the ability to see what version of the Azure Batch Node Agent is running on each of the VMs in a pool, via the new `NodeAgentInformation` property on `PSComputeNode`.
* Removed the `ValidationStatus` property from `PSTaskCounts`.
* The `Caching` default for `PSDataDisk` is now `ReadWrite` instead of `None`.
