# Docs
This directory contains the documentation of the cmdlets for the `Az.ServiceBus` module. This documentation is created by [platyPS](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/platyPS), the unofficial standard for producing documentation from cmdlets. To run documentation generation, use the `generate-help.ps1` script at the root module folder.

## Details
The process of documentation generation loads `Az.ServiceBus` and analyzes the exported cmdlets from the module. It notices the [help comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help) that are generated into the scripts in the `..\exports` folder. Additionally, when writing custom cmdlets in the `..\custom` folder, you can use the help comments syntax, which decorate the exported scripts at build-time.
