## Reference help documentation requirements

When writing reference documents for PowerShell cmdlets, please follow these guidelines to ensure readability and helpfulness:

1. **Avoid over-simplified description** - For parameters and cmdlets, avoid over-simplified description such as "Some help", or simply repeating the parameter name.
