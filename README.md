## Installation

### PowerShell Gallery
1. Install [Windows Management Framework 5 with PowerShellGet cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/gallery/psgallery/psgallery_gettingstarted) for Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, Server 2008 SP1, Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2.
2. In an elevated PowerShell session, run  ```Install-Module AzureRM```
3. To install legacy RDFE cmdlets, run ```Install-Module Azure```

### Microsoft Web Platform Installer

1. Install [Microsoft Web Platform Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx).
2. Open Microsoft Web Platform Installer and search for __Microsoft Azure PowerShell__.
3. Install.

You can also find the standalone installers for all versions of Azure PowerShell in the [releases section](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/releases)

### Supported PowerShell Versions

* [Windows Management Framework 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)
* [Windows Management Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855)
* [Windows Management Framework 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395)

## Using Azure PowerShell

In general, follow these steps to start using Microsoft Azure PowerShell

* Get yourself authenticated with Microsoft Azure. For details, please check out [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).
* Use the cmdlets

The first step can be different for the possible environments you could be targeting. The following are detailed instructions for each supported environment.

### Microsoft Azure

If you use both mechanisms on the same subscription, Microsoft Azure Active Directory authentication always wins. If you want to go back to management certificate authentication, please use ```Remove-AzureAccount```, which will remove the Microsoft Azure Active Directory information and bring management certificate authentication back in.

#### Login directly from PowerShell (Microsoft Azure Active Directory authentication)

```powershell
# Interactive login - you will get a dialog box asking for your Azure credentials
Add-AzureRmAccount

# Non-interactive login - use service principals
Add-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "http://my-app" -Credential $pscredential -TenantId $tenantid

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myresourceGroup -Location "West US"
```

### Microsoft Azure China

```powershell
Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureChinaCloud

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myresourceGroup -Location "China East"
```

### Microsoft Azure US Government

```powershell
Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myresourceGroup -Location "US Gov Virginia"
```

### Microsoft Azure Germany

```powershell
Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureGermanCloud

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myresourceGroup -Location "Germany Central"
```

### Windows Azure Pack

```powershell
# Add your Windows Azure Pack environment to your Microsoft Azure PowerShell installation.
# You will need to know the following information of your Windows Azure Pack environment.
# 1. URL to download the publish settings file    Mandatory
# 2. Management service endpoint                  Optional
# 3. Management Portal URL                        Optional
# 4. Storage service endpoint                     Optional
Add-WAPackEnvironment -Name "MyWAPackEnv" `
    -PublishSettingsFileUrl "URL to download the publish settings file>" `
    -ServiceEndpoint "<Management service endpoint>" `
    -ManagementPortalUrl "<Storage service endpoint>" `
    -StorageEndpoint "<Management Portal URL>"

# Download a file which contains the publish settings information of your subscription.
# Use the -Environment parameter to target your Windows Azure Pack environment.
# This will open a browser window and ask you to log in to get the file.
Get-WAPackPublishSettingsFile -Environment "MyWAPackEnv"

# Import the file you just downloaded.
# Notice that the file contains credential of your subscription so you don't want to make it public
# (like check in to source control, etc.).
Import-WAPackPublishSettingsFile "<file location>"

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-WAPackWebsite -Name mywebsite
```

## Find Your Way

All the cmdlets can be put into 3 categories:

1. ARM management cmdlets use the `AzureRm` prefix (New-AzureRmResourceGroup, Get-AzureRmVM)
2. Legacy RDFE management cmdlets use the `Azure` prefix (Get-AzureVM)
3. Data plane cmdlets that work in ARM or RDFE use the `Azure` prefix (Get-AzureBlob)


You can use the following cmdlet to find out all the cmdlets for your environment

```powershell
# Return all the cmdlets for Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
Get-Command *AzureRm*

# Return all the cmdlets for Microsoft Azure
Get-Command *Azure*

# Return all the cmdlets for Windows Azure Pack
Get-Command *WAPack*
```

If you want to migrate some scripts from Microsoft Azure to Windows Azure Pack or vice versa, as long as the cmdlets you are using are in category 1, you should be able to migrate smoothly.
