SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Version profiles provide a mechanism for managing powershell cmdlets that
    target  specific versions of azure services supported in different instances
    of Azure.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Different concrete instances of Azure (AzureCloud, AzureChinaCloud, 
    AzureGermanCloud, AzureUSGovernmentCloud, AzureStack) may have different 
    versions of Azure services installed, with different capabilities. Azure 
    Version Profiles provide a mechanism for managing these version differences.

    Each Azure instance has a discoverable set of supported version profiles.

    A user can select a version profile supported by the instances of Azure they
     target, and this version profile corresponds to versions of the Azure
    PowerShell  modules. Users can then select these Azure PowerShell module
    versions and be  confident that their scripts will work when targeting those
    Azure instances.
    The AzureRM.Bootstrapper module provides cmdlets to discover, acquire, and
    use  modules that are appropriate for the azure version profile you are targeting.
    You can also use Tags in the AzureRM modules to discover profile information
     for each module version.

    Tags for a Profile use the form VersionProfile:2019-03-01-hybrid
    The AzureRM bootstrapper module uses the PowerShell Gallery to install and 
    load needed modules when you want to target a specific version profile.

EXAMPLES
Finding appropriate version profiles
    Use the Get-AzureRmProfile cmdlet to discover available profile versions, 
    and profile versions supported by an Azure instance.

    Get-AzureRmProfile -ListAvailable

    lists all available version profiles.

    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2019-03-01-hybrid

    Installs and loads cmdlets for one of the listed profiles.

Targeting all Azure Instances
    Get-AzureRmProfile

    Lists the profiles that are currently installed on the machine.

    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2019-03-01-hybrid

    Installs and loads cmdlets compatible with one of the listed profiles.

Targeting the Latest Stable Features
    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile Latest

    Installs and loads the latest published cmdlets for Azure PowerShell.

Acquiring and Loading All Azure modules using the BootStrapper
    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile '2019-03-01-hybrid' -Force

    Checks if  modules compatible with the '2019-03-01-hybrid' profile are 
    installed in the current scope, downloads and installs the modules if
    necessary,  and then loads the modules in the current session.  You must
    open a new  PowerShell session to target a different version profile.  Using
    the  'Force' parameter installs the necessary modules without prompting.

Acquiring and Loading Selected Azure modules using the Bootstrapper
    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile '2019-03-01-hybrid' -Module AzureRM.Compute

    Checks if an AzureRM.Compute module compatible with the 
    '2019-03-01-hybrid' profile is installed in the current scope, downloads 
    and installs the module if necessary, and then loads the module in the 
    current session.  You must open a new PowerShell session to target a
    different  module.

Switching Between Version Profiles
    To switch between version profiles on a machine, in a new PowerShell window,
     execute the following cmdlet:

    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile '2019-03-01-hybrid'

    This loads the modules associated with the '2019-03-01-hybrid' profile in 
    the current session.  You must open a new PowerShell session to target a 
    different version profile.


Updating and Removing Profiles
    To update a profile to the latest versions in that profile and import
    updated  modules to the current session, execute the following cmdlet:

    Update-AzureRmProfile -Profile 'latest'

    This checks if the latest versions of Azure PowerShell modules are 
    installed, if not prompts the user if they should be installed and imports 
    them into the current session. This should always be executed in a new 
    PowerShell session.
    If you would like to update to the latest modules in a Profile and remove 
    previously installed versions of the modules, use:

    Update-AzureRmProfile -Profile 'latest' -RemovePreviousVersions

Setting and Removing Default Profiles
    To set or update a profile as a default to be used with all Azure PowerShell
     modules, execute the following cmdlet:

    Set-AzureRmDefaultProfile -Profile '2019-03-01-hybrid'

    The default profile selection is persisted across shells and sessions.
    After default profile is set using the above cmdlet,  the 'Import-Module'
    when used with AzureRm modules will automatically load Azure PowerShell 
    modules compatible with the given profile. You may also use API version 
    profile cmdlets without the '-profile' parameter.

    Import-Module AzureRM.Compute
    Use-AzureRmProfile
    Uninstall-AzureRmProfile

    To remove a default profile from all sessions and shells, execute the
    following  cmdlet:

    Remove-AzureRmDefaultProfile
