# PowerShell Best Practices

1. Write Platform-Agnostic Code

* Use Built-in Cmdlets and .NET APIs: Stick to cmdlets and APIs that are designed to be cross-platform. For instance, instead of hardcoding file paths, use .NET's [System.IO.Path]::Combine() or the Join-Path cmdlet.
* Avoid Windows-Only APIs: Steer clear of relying on Windows-specific features (like COM objects or certain registry access methods) unless you're handling those cases explicitly based on the operating system.

1. Manage File Paths and Case Sensitivity

* Normalize Paths: Use cross-platform methods for dealing with file paths. The file system on Linux and macOS is case-sensitive, so avoid assumptions about casing.
* Environment Variables: Use environment variables or PowerShell's automatic variables (like $env:HOME) to access user-specific directories reliably.

1. Handle Platform-Specific Behavior Gracefully

* Conditional Code Execution: Use conditional logic (for example, testing $PSVersionTable.PSEdition or $IsLinux, $IsMacOS, $IsWindows) to execute code that's appropriate for the detected OS.
* Testing on Multiple Platforms: Integrate automated testing on all target platforms (perhaps via CI pipelines) to catch any platform-specific issues early in development.

1. Use Modules and Packaging Best Practices

* Modular Design: Break your scripts into modules that encapsulate functionality. This makes it easier to manage platform differences by isolating them.
* Cross-Platform Packaging: When distributing your modules, consider using the PowerShell Gallery and ensure your manifest properly specifies supported platforms.
